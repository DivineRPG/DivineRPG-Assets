## 1.4.2
**Changes**
- Replaced/overhauled most of the block and item textures with modern equivalents (for example, a lot of 32x32 textures such as the Arcana/Vethea blocks and items have been made 16x16 to be more visually appealing.)
- Replaced the armor textures with their modern equivalents.
- Replaced most of the mob textures with their modern equivalents.
- Replaced/overhauled most of the projectile textures.
- Edited Iceika's grass texture so it always appears snowy, letting it blend in with actual snow.
- Made the Heat Trap block in Arcana animated when active.
- Made the Acceleron animated.
- Replaced the NPC merchant UIs so they're simpler and don't use super crunchy background images.
- Iceika isn't pitch-black anymore and can actually snow now.
- Both Iceika and Vethea have a sky and moon.
- Tweaked lots of things in the .lang files to be more up-to-date with modern versions of the mod.
- Tweaked Vethea boss dialogue to be more accurate to what's actually being said.
- Fixed certain item stack sizes.
- Made the Acid item green instead of red so it stays consistent with the Dream Lamp block.

**Fixes**
- Overhauled the hardness for a lot of blocks (Twilight dimension grass/dirt/wood doesnt take ages to mine anymore, some vethea dungeon blocks have been made unbreakable, etc.)
- Fixed the Vethea portal so when entering Vethea the player spawns in front of the portal frame instead of inside one of the corners, fixing a bug where sometimes the player instantly teleports back to the overworld due to wonky collision.
- Fixed a minor issue where Dramix instantly starts the fight invisible.
- Fixed the leaf blocks not being as shaded as vanilla leaves.
- Added missing ore dictionary compatibility for many of the blocks.
- (Mostly) fixed a bug causing the Orb of Light to leave behind light sources. This can still happen if you use an Ender Pearl, but you can just walk to the light source to get rid of it. I tried. :/

**Additions**
- Added missing ore dictionary compatibility for many of the blocks.
- Added a config option to toggle the Vethea-exclusive inventory system.
- Added a config option to toggle the welcome message upon entering a world.
- Added config options to toggle the structures in Iceika and Vethea.
- Added config options to set the dimension IDs for boss spawn items like the Mysterious Clock, Call of the Watcher, etc.

**Other**
- Disabled weather in Arcana since there's no point for it being there
- Added .lang support for all the item tooltips, as well as translations for them. Very useful for modpack authors!
- Changed the version number for when the update eventually happens.
- Updated the developer list.
